1. What is the problem the authors are trying to solve?
Named recognition recognition is an important subtask of NLP. Programmatic understanding of entities in text can help disambiguate and retrieve information.
2. What other approaches or solutions existed at the time that this work was done?
MAny others exists. Stanford NER, spaCy, Alias-i LingPipe NER, and NLTK are all implementations with varying levels of documentation. 
3. What was wrong with the other approaches or solutions?
They don't work together to build a tool larger than itself.
4. What is the authors' approach or solution?
Evaluate the a-four-mentioned tools and use the ones that perform the best.
5. Why is it better than the other approaches or solutions?
Because the ones they use are built by separate teams, they don't combine the results of each and pick the best one.
6. How did they test their solution?
They evaluated precision, recall, and F measure on a dataset of Singapore National Library eResources.
7. How does it perform?
It's unclear what is performing here. It appears to just be using two of the best methods to perform NER after evaluation determined they were the best, generally.
8. Why is this work important?
